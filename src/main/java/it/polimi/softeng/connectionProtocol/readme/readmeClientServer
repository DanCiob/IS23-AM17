the game proposes 3 different connection modes:

1) socket
    when using socket you can input the server ip and port OR press enter both times to use the default server and port combination
    found in the json configuration file
    warning : if you enter only the server ip/port it will use the default json file config

2) RMI
    when using this rmi mode you can either input a server ip or press enter and use the default server ip found in the config json
    files
    warning : do not use this mode for local testing as it tries to both servers and clients on port 1099

3) RMI for local testing
    this mode automatically opens connection on the server ip 127.0.0.1 and the first port from 1099 that it finds free

1) Socket mode
When connected in socket mode client-server communicate using JSON file written and read using parser and writer that
can be found in JSONParser and JSONWriter.

A message sent follows this sequence of operations:
i) Command is written by user and recognized by CLI (or eventually selected using GUI)
iia) If action is local (like visualize player Board or Shelfie) then CLI/GUI is self-sufficient and no JSON is sent
iib) If action needs server then actionToJSON is called with type of operation requested and body of request.
iii) JSON is sent to server using clientSide, the request is signed with type of action requested and nickname of
     requester (ClientSignatureWriter)
iv) JSON is received and parsed by server and read by ServerMessageHandler that calls appropriate controller action
v) Controller redirect action to GameController or ChatController (depending on request)
vi) GameController/ChatController sends message (encoded and signed by ServerSignatureWriter in JSON using writer) via
    serverSide
vii) Message is received via MessageHandler with similar steps of vi)

An update sent by server follows same path but only with vi) and vii) step

2) RMI (TBD)
